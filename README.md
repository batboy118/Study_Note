# Study_Note

This repository is for recording what I study, and is organized by categories. 

This repository is a combination of two old repositories. they are unmanaged now. [ [old_TIL](https://github.com/batboy118/old_TIL) & [old_Study-Code](https://github.com/batboy118/old_Study-Code) ]

You may use my repository for studying, but it would not be perfect.

If you find any errors, I will appreciate if you let me know by e-mailing me. [ 118jjh@gmail.com ]

Thank you!
